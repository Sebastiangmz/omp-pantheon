# omp-pantheon

**`omp-pantheon` is a local software-engineering harness for agentic coding.**
It is built on top of [oh-my-pi (OMP)](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi),
but it is not just a set of prompts: it turns OMP into a disciplined workflow
for taking an issue from intent → spec → evals/tests → implementation → review
→ evidence → optional enforcement.

If you are arriving here from GitHub with no prior context:

- **OMP original is the runtime engine.** It gives agents tools, providers,
  subagents, LSP/DAP, file editing, browser/debug/shell access, and the native
  `explore`/`plan`/`task` workflow.
- **`omp-pantheon` is the engineering system around that engine.** It adds
  specialist agents, durable memory, SpecSafe/Seshat slice discipline, EvalFly
  evaluation evidence, local completion gates, trace hygiene, branch-level E2E
  verification, review protocols, and installable project templates.
- **The core differentiator:** most agent harnesses help an AI edit code; this
  harness tries to make agentic work *reviewable and enforceable* by tying it to
  contracts, evidence, reports, traces, and PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE verdicts.

In practical terms, this repo is for people who want a local, hackable agentic
engineering cockpit: one that can coordinate specialized agents, remember
project context, require eval evidence for load-bearing work, verify real user
flows, and make it harder for an agent to simply say “done” without proof.

## What this repo contains

`omp-pantheon` currently bundles:

- **OMP-compatible agents** for planning, architecture, implementation, tests,
  validation, review, stewardship, and documentation.
- **SpecSafe/Seshat workflow discipline** so work is tied to explicit slices,
  source issues, acceptance criteria, and reviewable evidence.
- **Honcho memory integration** for durable recall/search across sessions when
  configured.
- **EvalFly**, a project-local evaluation-evidence system with `evals/`,
  deterministic suites, run JSON, markdown reports, trace import/normalization,
  privacy audits, comparisons, summaries, and explicit local enforcement.
- **Local enforcement hooks** that can block OMP session completion when a
  project has opted into EvalFly enforcement and matching passing evidence is
  missing.
- **Agentic branch E2E verification** for testing a feature branch as a real
  user with frozen criteria, UI/network/log/backend evidence, negative cases,
  and PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE verdicts.
- **Guardrails and lifecycle hooks** for todos, approvals, intent checks,
  comments, SpecSafe sessions/subagents, fallback audits, and artifact hygiene.
- **Dogfooding:** this repo contains its own root `evals/` smoke suite that
  protects critical harness files and proves EvalFly works on the harness itself.

## How this differs from other agent systems

This is not trying to be a SaaS observability product, cloud IDE, or benchmark
runner. Existing systems cover parts of the problem well:

- Claude Code, Codex, and OMP provide strong agent runtimes.
- OpenHands and HumanLayer focus on agent/session orchestration and software
  factory workflows.
- Braintrust and LangSmith focus on traces, evals, datasets, dashboards, and
  production observability.
- Inspect AI and OpenAI Evals focus on formal eval frameworks.
- SWE-agent focuses on issue-solving and SWE-bench-style agent evaluation.

`omp-pantheon` is different because it combines the local pieces into one OMP
bundle: runtime + specialist agents + SpecSafe + Honcho memory + EvalFly
evidence/enforcement + trace hygiene + branch E2E protocol. It is less mature
than those products in UI, cloud orchestration, visual observability, managed
datasets, and full CI/branch-protection automation; its advantage is that it is
local, inspectable, hackable, and shaped around an eval-first engineering loop.

## What makes it different from original OMP

| Area | Original OMP | `omp-pantheon` |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | General-purpose agent harness with tools, providers, subagents, LSP/DAP, and browser/debug adapters. | Keeps the OMP runtime, then installs a project-specific engineering discipline layer. |
| Agents | Native general agents such as `explore`, `plan`, `task`, `reviewer`, `designer`, and `librarian`. | Adds Pantheon and Seshat agents for strategy, specs, tests, implementation, validation, review, documentation, and stewardship. |
| Work contract | Depends on the prompt and project instructions. | Adds SpecSafe/Seshat slice discipline so work can be tied to a source issue, acceptance criteria, and reviewable evidence. |
| Memory | OMP session/history plus configured tools. | Adds Honcho durable memory tools for recall/search/conclusions across sessions when available. |
| Evaluations | No built-in project-local eval evidence contract. | Adds EvalFly: `evals/`, deterministic suites, run JSON, markdown reports, trace import/normalization/audit, compare/report/summary commands, and templates. |
| Enforcement | Normal harness/tool completion behavior. | Adds explicit local EvalFly enforcement: `evalfly enforce start` writes project-local state and the OMP stop gate blocks completion without fresh matching passing evidence. |
| Branch QA | Whatever the user asks the agent to test. | Adds `agentic-branch-e2e`: freeze criteria first, run real user flows, capture UI/network/log/backend evidence, drive negative cases, and emit PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE. |
| Safety boundary | OMP permissions and configured hooks. | Adds intent gates, approval gates, comment checks, SpecSafe hooks, EvalFly artifact hardening, privacy checks for sanitized traces, and non-global opt-in enforcement. |
| Dogfooding | Not applicable. | The repo contains its own `evals/` smoke suite protecting critical harness files and tests that keep the suite synchronized. |

## Current capability snapshot

Implemented and verified in this bundle:

- integrated Pantheon + Seshat/Ghola agent roster;
- SpecSafe, Linear/GitHub/docs, latest-docs, review, and verification skills;
- Honcho memory tool integration in the OMP extension layer;
- OMP slash commands including `/omomomo`, `/handoff`, `/start-work`,
  `/refactor`, `/remove-ai-slops`, and `/evalfly-enforce`;
- lifecycle hooks and guardrails for todo discipline, intent, comments,
  approvals, SpecSafe sessions/subagents, and fallback audits;
- EvalFly CLI commands: `validate`, `run`, `check`, `latest`, `list`,
  `summary`, `traces`, `audit-traces`, `compare`, `report`, `curate-trace`,
  `normalize-trace`, `import-session-trace`, and `enforce status/start/stop/explain`;
- local EvalFly enforced mode with project-local state under
  `.pi/evalfly/enforcement.json`;
- an OMP `session_stop` gate that requires matching fresh passing EvalFly
  evidence when enforced mode is active;
- metadata-only EvalFly trace buffering while enforcement is enabled;
- hardened run/report/trace artifact writes against path escape and symlink
  surprises;
- optional GitHub Actions templates for advisory and required EvalFly checks;
- bootstrap support for initializing project-local `evals/` with
  `--with-evalfly`;
- root `evals/` dogfood suite in this repository with ten critical smoke cases;
- tests covering EvalFly state, command parsing, stop-gate behavior, trace
  buffering, CLI behavior, and the dogfood eval repo;
- `agentic-branch-e2e` as the real-user branch verification protocol.

## What it does not claim yet

This repository is a strong opt-in evidence stack, not a fully closed global
evaluation platform. Today it does **not** automatically:

- protect every downstream repository;
- install GitHub branch protection or rulesets;
- capture every OMP trace persistently without an explicit project flow;
- execute LLM/human judges as required EvalFly runtime checks;
- evaluate full agentic workflows end-to-end inside the EvalFly runner;
- convert every branch-E2E run record into EvalFly evidence;
- promote traces into eval cases automatically;
- maintain hidden/dev eval splits;
- prune or deduplicate stale eval debt.

Those are explicit roadmap items, not completed claims.

## Typical issue flow

A fully loaded `omp-pantheon` session should handle a non-trivial issue like
this:

```text
issue
→ SpecSafe/Seshat slice and acceptance criteria
→ eval/test plan before implementation
→ EvalFly suite/check setup
→ optional evalfly enforce start --suite <suite> --commit-range <base>..<head>
→ implementation by specialist agents
→ unit/type/lint verification
→ EvalFly run JSON + canonical markdown report
→ sanitized trace import/normalization/audit when relevant
→ agentic-branch-e2e for UI or real user behavior
→ validator/reviewer verdicts against the original issue
→ local stop gate passes only if enforced evidence exists
```

Prompt an agent with:

```text
Resolve this issue using the full omp-pantheon flow: SpecSafe slice,
eval-first criteria, EvalFly local enforcement when appropriate, tests/evals
before implementation, implementation, EvalFly check/report, agentic-branch-e2e
if behavior is user-visible, validator/reviewer pass, artifact cleanup, and a
final evidence report. Do not close if required evidence is missing.
```

## Layout

```text
agents/                 OMP agent definitions (*.md)
commands/               OMP slash commands (*.md)
skills/<name>/SKILL.md  OMP skills and workflow protocols
skills/evalfly/          EvalFly templates, CLI, and adoption docs
evals/                  This repo's dogfood EvalFly smoke suite
hooks/*.ts              OMP lifecycle hooks from Seshat/SpecSafe
extensions/oh-my-omp/   loop runtime, Honcho integration, lifecycle hooks
test/                   integration/regression tests for the bundle
docs/                   public overview, EvalFly guides, plans, port notes
package.json            root test/typecheck/format/lint runner
install.sh              symlink/copy this bundle into ~/.omp/agent/
```

The directory tree mirrors `~/.omp/agent/`, so installation is just placing these
files where OMP's native discovery looks for them.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sebastiangmz/omp-pantheon
cd omp-pantheon
./install.sh            # symlinks the bundle into ~/.omp/agent/ (re-runnable)
```

Then start `omp`; the agents, commands, skills, hooks, EvalFly tooling, and OMP
extension are live. Enforced EvalFly mode remains project-local and must be
explicitly activated per repo/session.

## Status

`omp-pantheon` is actively updated and dogfooded. The current honest status is:
**local integrated harness with strong opt-in evidence/enforcement**, not yet a
complete always-on 38/40 closed-loop evaluation platform. See the docs above for
the implemented layers and the remaining roadmap.
