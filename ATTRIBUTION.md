# Attribution

`omp-pantheon` is a personal-config-tree port for [oh-my-pi (OMP)](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi).
It is **not** a redistribution of any upstream harness; it adapts prompt content
and concepts to OMP's native tool grammar.

## Sources

- **Engine:** [oh-my-pi (OMP)](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) — MIT. The
  underlying coding agent. This repo only ships config (agents/commands/skills/hooks)
  discovered by OMP; no OMP source is vendored.
- **Pantheon / OMO layer:** agents, skills, commands, loop, and hook concepts
  derived from [oh-my-openagent (OMO)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent),
  licensed **SUL-1.0**. Original author: [@code-yeongyu](https://github.com/code-yeongyu).
  Content here is adapted (re-grammared) for OMP, not copied verbatim where the
  underlying tool surface differs.
- **Seshat / pi-seshat layer:** Ghola agents, SpecSafe discipline, Honcho
  durable-memory bridge, Linear/GitHub/docs/memory skills, lifecycle hooks, and
  the associated tests/port notes come from the local `pi-seshat` work integrated
  into this OMP bundle. They are credited separately because they are not part of
  the OMO prompt lineage.

## Grammar mapping (OMO → OMP)

| OMO | OMP |
|---|---|
| `task(subagent_type=…, prompt=…)` | `task(agent: "…", tasks: [{ id, description, assignment }])` |
| `category="…", load_skills=[…]` | `agent: "task"` with skills loaded in the assignment |
| `call_omo_agent` | `task` |
| `lsp_diagnostics` / `LspGotoDefinition` / `LspFindReferences` / `lsp_rename` | `lsp(action: "diagnostics" / "definition" / "references" / "rename")` |
| `ast_grep_search` / `ast_grep_replace` | `ast_grep` / `ast_edit` |
| Team Mode (`team_*`) | parallel `task` subagent batches |

## Licensing note

Because OMO-derived content is SUL-1.0, this tree inherits SUL-1.0 obligations
for that content. If this is ever published as an installable package (vs. a
personal config tree), licensing will be re-evaluated and explicit upstream
permission sought where required.
